**Project Name**
**Overview**
This project is an ambitious backend development initiative aimed at building a scalable and efficient application architecture using microservices. The foundation of this project is laid in TypeScript, leveraging the power of NestJS for structuring the application, and SQL for database management. The goal is to create a robust system that can support future growth and scalability.

**Technologies Used**
TypeScript: The primary programming language used for developing the application. TypeScript offers static typing, which enhances code quality and maintainability.
NestJS: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. NestJS is chosen for its modular architecture, which promotes code reusability and separation of concerns.
PostgreSQL: For database management, PostgreSQL is used to ensure data integrity and efficient data retrieval. The choice of PostgreSQL database is based on its robustness and support for complex queries.
Microservices Architecture: The application is designed following the microservices pattern, which allows for independent deployment, scaling, and development of each service.

**Project Status**
The project is currently under development and is expected to be completed in approximately two weeks. While the work is not yet finished, significant progress has been made towards the project goals. The team is committed to delivering a high-quality product that meets the requirements and exceeds expectations.
