# Back-end for e-commerce 
## Overview
This project is a backend development initiative aimed at building a scalable and efficient application architecture using microservices. The foundation of this project is laid in TypeScript, leveraging the power of NestJS for structuring the application, and PostgreSQL for database management. This project wouldn't have been possible without the guidance of soyHenry instructors, my companions, and, of course, myself.


## Technologies Used
**TypeScript**: The primary programming language used for developing the application. TypeScript offers static typing, which enhances code quality and maintainability.
**NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. NestJS is chosen for its modular architecture, which promotes code reusability and separation of concerns.
**PostgreSQL**: For database management, PostgreSQL is used to ensure data integrity and efficient data retrieval. The choice of PostgreSQL database is based on its robustness and support for complex queries.
**Microservices Architecture**: The application is designed following the microservices pattern, which allows for independent deployment, scaling, and development of each service.

## Additional Technologies and Tools
**Jest**: Used for testing the application. Jest provides a comprehensive testing framework that ensures the reliability and stability of the application.
**Docker**: Employed for containerization. Docker allows for easy deployment and scaling of the application across different environments, ensuring consistency and reducing the "it works on my machine" problem.
**Render**: Utilized for deployment. Render offers a seamless deployment process, providing scalable and reliable hosting for the application.
